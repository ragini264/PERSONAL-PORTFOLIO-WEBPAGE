DESCRIPTION OF PROJECT : The “Personal Portfolio Webpage” is an essential and foundational project for any aspiring web developer. This task, assigned as part of the CODTECH internship, is designed to help interns understand the structure, aesthetics, and functionality of a personal branding website. It provides hands-on experience in using core front-end technologies — HTML and CSS — to design, develop, and deploy a fully responsive single-page website that highlights a developer's professional profile, education, skills, and portfolio.
The main goal of this project is to create a personal digital presence for the developer that can be shared with potential employers, clients, or collaborators. This personal portfolio serves as a modern-day resume, offering more interactivity and showcasing projects and achievements in a visual format.

Key Objectives:

1. Develop a Single-Page Application (SPA):
The task demands a one-page website, meaning all the content such as the homepage, about section, education, skills, projects, and contact information should be smoothly accessible on a single scrolling page with appropriate navigation links.
2. Responsive Design:
The webpage must be mobile-friendly and compatible with various screen sizes including tablets, laptops, and smartphones. This ensures a smooth user experience across devices, which is a critical requirement in modern web development.
3. User-Friendly Navigation:
The website must include a navigation bar that allows users to jump to different sections like "About", "Projects", "Education", "Skills", and "Contact". The use of anchor tags, smooth scrolling effects, and possibly some JavaScript enhancements can make this more dynamic.


4. Professional Layout and Visual Design:
HTML provides the structure, while CSS is used to make the webpage visually appealing. The project should follow a clean layout, good typography, consistent color scheme, and appropriate spacing and alignment to enhance readability and professionalism.

Sections to be Included in the Portfolio:

1. Home Section:
This section includes the developer's name, a brief tagline or role (e.g., "Front-End Developer", "MCA Student", etc.), and a welcome message. It acts as the first impression for visitors.
2. About Me:
This area provides an introduction including background, interests in web development, education history, career goals, and a short personal story.
3. Education:
Display academic qualifications such as school, college, current degree (e.g., MCA), year of passing, and any certifications relevant to programming or web development.
4. Skills:
A list of technical skills such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, C, C++, Python, Java, SQL, and more. You can also include soft skills like communication, teamwork, and problem-solving.
5. Projects:
This section is the highlight of the portfolio. Showcase academic or personal projects, ideally with a description, tools used, and links (if deployed on GitHub or live). Clicking on a project name/image can open a detailed view of that project.
6. Contact Form or Details:
A contact form with fields like name, email, subject, and message should be included. Alternatively, display contact info such as email address, phone number, and social media links (LinkedIn, GitHub, etc.).
